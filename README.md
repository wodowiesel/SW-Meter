## DISCLAIMERS

This is still "work-in-progress (WIP)" so I do NOT take any kind of warranty/responsibility for damages or data losses!

You can use this at your own risk without any guarantees and put device on non-conductive surface or enclosure!

If you like the new design you are free to share it!

Have fun and 73 :)
